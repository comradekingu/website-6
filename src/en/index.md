# Why lapwing?

 Appointment scheduling system designed for the **common good**, operated **without commercial interests**.

Kiebitz is a gratis **libre software** system for vaccination appointment scheduling. \
It is designed from **Privacy By Design** principles and systematically minimizes privacy and security risks for users of the system. \
The software also protects operators of localities, preventing data collected for appointment scheduling from being used elsewhere at a technical level.

Kiebitz easily operated **decentrally**, data can be stored **fail-safe** and **redundantly** in a **federated infrastructure**. \
It is also the only appointment scheduling system implementing true **end-to-end encryption** of data. \
Unprovoked decryption of personal data is not possible with Kiebitz, as control over data lies solely with respective subjects and vaccinating physicians [^1]. \
This gives less opportunity for collection and analysis of not only data, but also metadata which also poses significant privacy risk in appointment scheduling systems. \
We are convinced Kiebitz is the most **privacy-friendly** vaccination appointment scheduling software. \
It also meets all legal requirements for data protection and data security according to DSGVO, setting it further apart from commercially driven systems. \
Appointment brokering should not be a business model.
