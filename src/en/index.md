# Why lapwing?

 Appointment brokering should not be a business model. Appointment
scheduling software should be designed for the **common good** and operated **without commercial interests**.

Kiebitz is an **open source**, **free-to-use** software system for vaccination appointment scheduling. It is designed according to **Privacy By Design** principles and systematically minimizes privacy & security risks for users of the system. The software also protects operators of localities and technically prevents data collected for appointment scheduling from being used elsewhere. 

Kiebitz can be very easily operated **decentrally**, data can be stored **fail-safe** and **redundantly** in a **federated infrastructure**. Kiebitz is also the only appointment scheduling system that implements **true end-to-end encryption of** data.
An unprovoked decryption of personal data is not possible with Kiebitz, but the control over the data lies solely with data subjects and vaccinating physicians [^1].
In addition, Kiebitz systematically minimizes opportunities to collect and analyze meta-data, which also poses a significant privacy risk in appointment scheduling systems in addition to the actual data collected. We are convinced that Kiebitz is the **most privacy-friendly vaccination appointment scheduling software**. It also meets all legal requirements for data protection and data security according to DSGVO and should therefore be preferred over commercially operated systems.
